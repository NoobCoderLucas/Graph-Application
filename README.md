# Meeting Scheduler

The Meeting Scheduler is a simple Java console application that uses a graph structure to efficiently organize and manage meetings and their attendees. The application is designed for workplaces, teams, or groups that need an easy way to schedule meetings and keep track of participants.

What It Can Do:

1.Schedule Meetings: Create a meeting by entering its name, date, and time.

2.Add Attendees: Add people to the meeting to keep track of who is attending.

3.Remove Attendees: If someone can’t attend, you can easily remove them from the meeting list.

4.View Attendees: Check who is attending each meeting by viewing a list of participants.

5.View All Meetings: Get a list of all scheduled meetings, helping you stay on top of your schedule.

6..Exit the System: Users can choose to exit the application at any time, closing the program gracefully.

Why I Made This Application:

I created this app to practice using graph structures in a practical way. Scheduling meetings and tracking attendees can be time-consuming and complicated, especially when managing multiple events. I wanted to develop a simple, efficient tool that can help streamline the process. This application allows users to easily schedule meetings and keep track of participants, saving time and effort in organizing and managing events. It’s a useful tool for anyone who needs to stay organized and ensure that meetings run smoothly.
